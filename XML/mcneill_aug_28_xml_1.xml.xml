<directions>
    <step n="1"><equipment type="utensil">Whisk</equipment> together <ingredient type="dry">the flours</ingredient>, <ingredient type="dry">yeast</ingredient> and <ingredient type="dry">salt</ingredient> in <equipment type="bakeware">a mixing bowl</equipment>. Combine the <ingredient type="wet">cider</ingredient> and <ingredient type="wet">water</ingredient> in <equipment type="bakeware">a liquid measuring cup</equipment>.</step>
    <step n="2">Add <ingredient type="wet">the liquid</ingredient> to <ingredient type="dry">the flour mixture</ingredient>; use <optional><equipment type="utensil">a spatula</equipment> or <equipment type="utensil">bench scraper</equipment> or your hand moistened with water to blend them for about <time type="minute">a minute</time></optional>. <appraisal>The dough should be shaggy yet cohesive</appraisal>.</step>
    <step n="3">Cover <equipment type="bakeware">the bowl</equipment> with <equipment type="fabric">a towel</equipment>; let the dough rest for <time type="minute">20 minutes</time>.</step>
    <step n="4">Moisten your kneading hand. <optional>If the dough seems stiff, add <measurement type="teaspoon">a tablespoon</measurement> of <ingredient type="wet">water</ingredient>.</optional></step>
    <step n="5">Stretch one edge of the dough (still in the bowl), then press it into the center of <equipment type="bakeware">the bowl</equipment>. Repeat this about a dozen times, moving clockwise to catch all sides of the dough. <appraisal>(This should take <time type="minute">1 or 2 minutes</time>.)</appraisal></step>
    <step n="6">Turn the dough over so the seams are on the bottom. Cover and let rest for <time type="minute">20 minutes</time>. Repeat the clockwise stretching and folding two more times, with <time type="minute">20-minute rests</time> after each. Cover and refrigerate at least <time type="hour">8 hours</time> and up to <time type="day">24 hours</time>. <appraisal>The dough should have doubled.</appraisal> If it hasn't, leave it on the counter until it does.</step>
    <step n="7">Lightly flour a work surface. Use <optional><equipment type="fabric">a pastry cloth</equipment> or <equipment type="fabric">clean dish towel</equipment></optional> to line <equipment type="utensil">a round colander</equipment>. Dust <equipment type="fabric">the cloth</equipment> with <ingredient type="dry">flour</ingredient>.</step>
    <step n="8">Transfer the dough to the floured work surface. Fold the edges toward the center to create a round shape, turning it over so the seams are on the bottom.</step> 
    <step n="9">Let it rest for <time type="minute">5 minutes</time>, then transfer to the <equipment type="utensil">colander</equipment>, seam side up. Cover with <equipment type="fabric">a towel</equipment> and let the dough rise for <time type="hour">1 1/2 hours</time>.</step>
    <step n="10"><time type="minute">Thirty minutes</time> before baking, place <optional><equipment type="bakeware">a cast-iron Dutch oven (lid on)</equipment> or <equipment type="bakeware">enameled cast-iron pot with a lid (on)</equipment></optional> in the oven; preheat to <temperature>475 degrees</temperature>.</step>
    <step n="11">Carefully remove the hot pot from the oven.</step>
    <step n="12">Turn the dough out onto the counter so the seams are on the bottom. Use <equipment type="utensil">kitchen scissors</equipment> to make <measurement type="snip">8 snips</measurement> on the top of the dough in an evenly spaced spoke pattern, each about <measurement type="inch">1/4-inch deep</measurement>.</step>
    <step n="13">Lift the dough and carefully drop it into <equipment type="bakeware">the hot pot</equipment>. Immediately cover with the hot lid. Bake for <temperature>30 minutes</temperature>, then reduce the heat to <temperature>450 degrees</temperature>. Uncover and bake for <time type="minute">8 to 10 minutes</time> or <appraisal>until the crust is dark brown</appraisal>. Try to minimize the amount of time the oven door is open.</step>
<appraisal>The bread is done when its internal temperature registers <temperature>205 degrees</temperature> on <equipment type="bakeware">an instant-read thermometer</equipment> and the loaf sounds hollow when knocked on the underside.</appraisal>
    <step n="14">Transfer the loaf to <equipment type="bakeware">a wire rack</equipment> to cool for at least <time type="hour">1 hour</time> before cutting.</step>

<!--lm: is there a better attribute to use for optional? for instanse, sometimes the recipe would offer two options and I just used the optional attribe to show that, but I'm wondering if there was a better method for it? -->
<!--lm: similarly, I used two measurement attributes for both grams and cups, but is there anyway to use one measurement attribute and show two types to it? [<measurement> type="cups" 1/4 cups type="grams" (140 grams) </measurement>] -->
<!--lm: I used appraisal for information the author included on what it should look like through the process but I don't think that was the best word to use. -->
