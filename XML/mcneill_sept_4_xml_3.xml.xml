<!--lm: I've never read this book, but the movie is about to come out and I just kept seeing this excerpt and couldn't help myself. -->
<!--lm: An attribute I put with Boris is age="fifteen?". The question mark is because I'm not sure if he was fifteen or sixteen; he's a year older than Theo, but the book mentioned Theo's birthday, so I wasn't sure if Boris' birthday had also passed. -->
<!--lm: I didn't think it was long until I did it. -->
