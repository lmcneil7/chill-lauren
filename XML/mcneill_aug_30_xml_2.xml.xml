Is this fit usage for <formal lackOf="contradiction">any body</formal>? had I stole or behaved in the <exaggeration>most abominable</exaggeration> way to <pronoun referenceTo="Henry_Drury">him</pronoun>, <pronoun referenceTo="Henry_Drury">his</pronoun> language could not have been <exaggeration>more outrageous</exaggeration>.

If I had done anything <exaggeration>so heinous</exaggeration>, why should <pronoun referenceTo="Henry_Drury">he</pronoun> allow me to stay at the <location specific="Harrow_School">school</location>? Why should <pronoun referenceTo="Henry_Drury">he</pronoun> <pronoun referenceTo="Henry_Drury">himself</pronoun> be <exaggeration>so criminal</exaggeration> as to overlook faults which merit the <vocabulary kind="academic" meaning="title" partOfSpeech="noun">appellation</vocabulary> of a <nickname referenceTo="Lord_Byron" usedBy="Henry_Drury" synonym="rascal">blackguard</nickname>?

    <!--lm: I pointed out some nouns; nouns he capitalized and nouns he didn't capitalized. I used the reason attribute for the capitalized nouns to talk about why he capitalized them and the importance attribute for the non-capitalized to talk about why he didn't capitalized and what it shows about him. -->
