    <!--lm: I pointed out some nouns; nouns he capitalized and nouns he didn't capitalized. I used the reason attribute for the capitalized nouns to talk about why he capitalized them and the importance attribute for the non-capitalized to talk about why he didn't capitalized and what it shows about him. -->
